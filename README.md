# TemperatureField
Temperature field in a chip and its heat dissipation fin. Code in MatLab implementing a 2D finite difference method.

Since the system is made of a chip and the fin, there is the possibility to solve and plot the fields first in the fin, then in the chip (run TesinaMain.m and then TesinaGenerazione.m).
Otherwise, to see the plot of the temperature field in the whole system you can just run TesinaMainTotal.
The pdf file contains a brief discussion about the problem that was numerically solved and a more detailed explanation of the equations. I'm sorry that it is written in Italian.
